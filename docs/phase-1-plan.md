   - User acceptance testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility

3. **Validation Criteria**
   - Intuitive user interface
   - Reliable file upload
   - Correct display of results
   - Working CSV export

### Technical Requirements

#### File Processing Service
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- PyPDF2
- Pillow
- pytest for testing

#### OCR Service
- Python 3.11+
- Tesseract OCR
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- pytest for testing

#### Frontend
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Material-UI
- Jest for testing

### Success Criteria for Phase 1
1. Successfully process PDF and image floor plans
2. Extract company names with 90% accuracy
3. Extract booth sizes with 85% accuracy
4. Process files under 2 minutes
5. Export results to CSV format
6. Pass all unit and integration tests
7. Meet performance benchmarks

### Next Steps
1. Set up development environment for File Processing Service
2. Implement file upload and conversion
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Get validation before proceeding to OCR implementation

Note: Each stage must be fully completed, tested, and validated before moving to the next stage. Documentation will be updated based on actual implementation details and learnings.
